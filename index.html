            <img src="Cristiano Ronaldo wallpaper.jpeg" alt="">
            <p>Ronaldoâ€™s father, JosÃ© Dinis Aveiro, was the equipment manager for the local club Andorinha. (The name Ronaldo was added to Cristianoâ€™s name in honor of his fatherâ€™s favorite movie actor, Ronald Reagan) At age 15 Ronaldo was diagnosed with a heart condition that necessitated surgery, but he was sidelined only briefly and made a full recovery. He first played for Clube Desportivo Nacional of Madeira and then transferred to Sporting Clube de Portugal, where he played for that clubâ€™s various youth teams before making his debut on Sportingâ€™s first team in 2002.A tall player at 6 feet 1 inch, Ronaldo was a formidable athlete on the pitch. Originally a right-winger, he developed into a forward with a free-reined attacking style. He was able to mesmerize opponents with a sleight of foot that made sufficient space for openings in opposing defenses.</p>

        <div class="internationalcarrer">
            <p>At the age of 18, Ronaldo made his debut for Portugal as a substitute against Kazakhstan on 20 August 2003.At UEFA Euro 2004, he scored his first international goal in a 2â€“1 group stage loss to Greece in his eighth international appearance.Despite Portugal losing to Greece again in the final, Ronaldo made the team of the tournament, with two assists and two goals.In the 2006 FIFA World Cup, at the age of 21 years and 132 days, Ronaldo became the youngest ever goalscorer for Portugal at a World Cup finals.Portugal reached the semi-finals, where Portugal lost to France, with Ronaldo being booed during their defeat, due to an incident ocurred in the quarter-finals against England.FIFA's Technical Study Group overlooked him for the tournament's Best Young Player award and handed it to Germany's Lukas Podolski, citing his behaviour as a factor in the decision.</p>
